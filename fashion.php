      <p>Be yourself. Not only dare to be yourself, but have the opportunity to be yourself.
         Even though we live in the year 2019, unfortunately there are a tons of people who cannot be themselves.
         Tons of people in the LGBTQ+ comunnity for example, who are either born to a religious family, or simply raised in a closed-minded community.
         Almost every male homoseksual I know says to prefer not to show any public display of affection, not only because of what other people might think, but the actions that might come becuase of it.
         The events in 2016, in Orlando, proved it can take just one idiot who doesn't agree with a certain lifestyle (that doesn't affect his life in any way whatsoever) for you to get killed, wounded or extremely traumatized.
         The brand 'WOLVES' stands for being yourself, even though you might not know who that is yet, but knowing that whoever you want to be is okay.
         Even if it takes you twenty, thirty, or even forty years to get to your true self,
         the most important thing is that eventually you will.
         Besides, 20% of the profits go to LGBTQ+ charities, so with every product you buy you're supporting a powerful cause.
